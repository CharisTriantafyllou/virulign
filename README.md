VIRULIGN is a tool for codon-correct pairwise alignments, with an augmented functionality to annotate the alignment according the positions of the proteins. We present a [tutorial](https://github.com/rega-cev/virulign-tutorial) demonstrating VIRULIGN's functionality for three different pathogens (i.e., HIV-1, Dengue virus, Zika virus).

Please download releases for GNU/Linux, MacOS and Windows [here](https://github.com/rega-cev/virulign/releases). To install the download, just put the virulign binary in a directory that is in your PATH environment. To build VIRULIGN from source have a look at the [BUILD.txt file](BUILD.txt).
